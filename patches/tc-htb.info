tc-htb is not a patch, but a binary.
It's an HTB- and MPU-enabled tc binary (the one I use).
Use it if you can't find or apply the patches for the iproute.

All patches used for this binary are available on the official HTB page.

There's two patches, one for HTB in general and one for HTB-MPU.
You only need the latter if you intend to use MPU, which is probably
a good thing to do.
