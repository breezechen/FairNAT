This directory contains kernel patches I use (mostly for better performance).
They are all NOT made by me. Use at your own risk. Better get the newest
versions of these patches directly off the net or something.

Please see the respictive .info files for more information on each patch.

There's also a binary: tc-htb. This is a patched tc with HTB and HTB-MPU
and HTB-OVERHEAD support. See tc-htb.info for details.
