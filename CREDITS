Thanks to...
* www.lartc.org for the great HOWTO. Without it, I could never
  have managed to even start writing this script.
* www.docum.org for great overall FAQ and Hints, as well as the KPTD.
* the LARTC mailing list where all sorts of people discussed methods,
  published their scripts, and helped me out.
* all those people who sent mails with suggestions, feature requests,
  and other stuff. It's their fault that Fair NAT contains tons of
  features I don't need nor use myself. ;-)
