  did some modifications based on Stef Coene's suggestions:
  corrected prio values, removed qdisc burst, normalized child rates,
  lowered total rate values, added quantums. Thanks, Stef!
---- 2003-10-22 ---- Andreas Klauer ----
  new class structure, because the old one grew too big
  and having too many classes proved to perform really, really bad
---- 2004-02-19 ---- Andreas Klauer ----
  replaced $BIN_BC/echo calculations with $((a*b/c)) syntax for readability
  added REAL_RATE_UP, REAL_RATE_DOWN for easier rate manipulation
  added sfq and tbf for prio qdisc classes
---- 2004-04-30 ---- Andreas Klauer ----
  removed tbf since it didn't do anything useful anyway.
  straightened out sfq qdiscs.
  prioritizing ACK packets; modifying TOS; as shown by Stef Coene
  on www.docum.org (great page, thanks, actually I use loads of
  hints from there and got great results!)
---- 2004-04-30 ---- Andreas Klauer ----
  Added ingress queue again
  Stupid me, forgot the 'bps' after rate values here and there.
  This messed everything up :-)
---- 2004-05-01 ---- Andreas Klauer ----
  Added much more flexible user and port forwarding handling.
  The script now supports any number of users (as long as they
  are in the same subnet) and complex port forwarding rules.
      The downside to this is that the script looks more complicated
  now. I tried to compensate this effect by adding lots of hopefully
  helpful comments.
---- 2004-05-03 ---- Andreas Klauer ----
  For better readability, moved all variables that are used for basic
  configuration into a separate file. Now people who don't want to
  change the script itself don't even need to take a look at it.
---- 2004-05-03 ---- Andreas Klauer ----
  Moved Change-Entries from the Script into a separate file CHANGELOG.
  Looks like there already was another project/script called ipshape.
  I renamed the script from ipshape to fairnat to avoid confusion.
---- 2004-05-03 ---- v0.69 ---- Andreas Klauer ----
  Nothing big, just a small bugfix and some typos.
  Included some of the kernel patches I use.
---- 2004-05-05 ---- v0.70 ---- Andreas Klauer ----
  Restructured the whole script. I use subroutines now. Means less C&P.
  Added command line arguments stop, info and <file>.
  Added User grouping. Lets you treat multiple IPs as single user.
  New kernel-patch: htb removes HTB_HYSTERIES. May be good for pings on
  slow lines like mine.
---- 2004-05-06 ---- v0.71 ---- Andreas Klauer ----
  Class numbers are now derived from user IP instead of array index.
  This makes reading tc statistics much easier.
---- 2004-05-08 ---- v0.72 ---- Andreas Klauer ----
  Added experimental support for IPP2P. If you use it, you can either
  disable all P2P traffic in general or allow it with lowest priority.
---- 2004-05-10 ---- v0.73 ---- Andreas Klauer ----
  User upload rates were not calculated correctly (rate was set far
  too high, even heigher than ceil) since v0.69 and nobody noticed.
  This bug caused a lot of unnecessary packet drops.
---- 2004-05-12 ---- v0.74 ---- Andreas Klauer ----
  Improved 'tc' binary detection. Now looks for both tc-htb and tc.
  Moved code from start_fairnat to new function parent_class for easier
  class structure (shaping method) replacement. Normalized iptables calls.

  New features to be enabled in the config file:
    - Turn bandwidth borrowing/lending off. (BORROW)
    - MSS Clamping hack. (MSS_CLAMP)
    - Drop previously marked IPP2P connections. (IPP2P_DROP_MARKED)
    - Use different class structures. (CLASS_MODE)

  Added 'Wondershaper'-alike class structure (CLASS_MODE="wonder").
---- 2004-05-13 ---- v0.75 ---- Andreas Klauer ----
  New hacks: HTB_MPU and HTB_OVERHEAD
  I label them hacks because these require a special patched tc binary.
---- 2004-08-07 ---- v0.76 ---- Andreas Klauer ----
  Mini-Update: Forgot to remove some debug stuff.
---- 2004-10-22 ---- v0.77 ---- Andreas Klauer ----
  Added USER_CEIL_UP and USER_CEIL_DOWN. You can use it to set all users
  to a ceil rate lower than total available bandwidth.
---- 2004-11-15 ---- v0.78 ---- Andreas Klauer ----
  The IP address wasn't detected correctly for localized 'ifconfig's.
  Made the previously hardcoded TTL setting configurable.
