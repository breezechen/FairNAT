  did some modifications based on Stef Coene's suggestions:
  corrected prio values, removed qdisc burst, normalized child rates,
  lowered total rate values, added quantums. Thanks, Stef!
---- 2003-10-22 ---- Andreas Klauer ----
  new class structure, because the old one grew too big
  and having too many classes proved to perform really, really bad
---- 2004-02-19 ---- Andreas Klauer ----
  replaced $BIN_BC/echo calculations with $((a*b/c)) syntax for readability
  added REAL_RATE_UP, REAL_RATE_DOWN for easier rate manipulation
  added sfq and tbf for prio qdisc classes
---- 2004-04-30 ---- Andreas Klauer ----
  removed tbf since it didn't do anything useful anyway.
  straightened out sfq qdiscs.
  prioritizing ACK packets; modifying TOS; as shown by Stef Coene
  on www.docum.org (great page, thanks, actually I use loads of
  hints from there and got great results!)
---- 2004-04-30 ---- Andreas Klauer ----
  Added ingress queue again
  Stupid me, forgot the 'bps' after rate values here and there.
  This messed everything up :-)
---- 2004-05-01 ---- Andreas Klauer ----
  Added much more flexible user and port forwarding handling.
  The script now supports any number of users (as long as they
  are in the same subnet) and complex port forwarding rules.
      The downside to this is that the script looks more complicated
  now. I tried to compensate this effect by adding lots of hopefully
  helpful comments.

  For better readability, moved all variables that are used for basic
  configuration into a separate file. Now people who don't want to
  change the script itself don't even need to take a look at it.
---- 2004-05-03 ---- Andreas Klauer ----
  Moved Change-Entries from the Script into a separate file CHANGELOG.
  Looks like there already was another project/script called ipshape.
  I renamed the script from ipshape to fairnat to avoid confusion.
---- 2004-05-03 ---- v0.69 ---- Andreas Klauer ----
  Nothing big, just a small bugfix and some typos.
  Included some of the kernel patches I use.
