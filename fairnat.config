# File:        fairnat.config
# Description: Configuration file for the fairnat.sh Script
#              You can do all the basic stuff here.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# --- LAN & Clients ---

# Specify the network device which is connected with your clients.
# The script assumes that this device has one static IP.
DEV_LAN=eth1

# Please tell me how fast your local area network is in kbit/s.
# It must be higher than your internet connection speed.
#
# If your internet connection is the same speed as your LAN, use
# a higher value here anyway - collisions between download and
# local traffic can't be avoided then.
#
# Default is 2000kbit == 2MBit. Please keep in mind that even on
# a 10Mbit/100MBit LAN you rarely can use the full rate (because
# of overhead, collisions, etc.).
RATE_LAN=2000

# Specify the clients for which we do Masquerading and Shaping.
# The script assumes that all clients have static IPs in the
# same subnet as your LAN device.
#
# Example: If the IP of DEV_LAN is 192.168.100.42, the line above
#          means that 192.168.100.2, 192.168.100.5, etc., are
#          the IPs of your clients.
#          6:23:25 is a group of 3 IPs that all belong to the same user.
#          Use this notation if a single person has more than one machine
#          /IP connected to the router.
USERS="2 5 6:23:25 183"

# If you have clients which need certain port (ranges) to be forwarded,
# specify them here. The format is "client port client port ...".
# The example below will forward ports 4000-6999 to 192.168.100.2 and
# ports 2000-3999 to 192.168.100.183.
PORTS="2 4000:6999 183 2000:3999"
# PORTS="" # this disables port forwarding.

# --- Internet ---

# Specify the network device that is connected to the internet.
# If you are a dialup user, you have to re-run the script every
# time you redial.
DEV_NET=ppp0

# Specify the upload speed of your internet connection in kbit/s.
# Since ISPs tend to overestimate the speeds they offer, it would
# probably be best if you measure this on a free line.
RATE_UP=128          # 128 kbit (common value for DSL in germany)

# Specify the download speed of your internet connection in kbit/s.
# Same as RATE_UP, you probably should measure this.
RATE_DOWN=768        # 768 kbit (common value for DSL in germany)

# In order to prevent traffic queuing at the ISP side or in your modem,
# we shape to a slightly lower rate. This way the bottleneck is the router,
# not the ISP or modem, which allows us more direct control of shaping.
# Per default, we sub 5% of bandwidth for this. If you do not have the
# bottleneck problem, set it to 0.
RATE_SUB_PERCENT=5

# How much % of the bandwidth should be allowed for the router?
# Use a minimum of 1 here. The router needs bandwidth for DNS caching
# (recommended), and services like FTP and Web (not recommended).
# If you use a too high value, your users will starve.
# If you use a too low value, your router will starve :-)
RATE_LOCAL_PERCENT=5
