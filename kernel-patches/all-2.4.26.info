all-2.4.26

  This file contains all patches I use. I made one big patch because the
  single patches tend to conflict with each other.

  Here's a detailed list of everything this patch contains:
  - TTL-Target:     Allows you to modify the TTL value of packets
  - CONNMARK:       Connection marking. Required for IPP2P (not included)
  - HTB-Hysteries:  Disable HTB Hysteries for latency reasons.
  - PSCHED-Cpu:     Use PSCHED_CPU instead of PSCHED_JIFFIES for performance reasons.
  - SFQ-Length:     Reduce SFQ queue length from 128 to 16 for latency reasons.

  TTL-Target and CONNMARK are part of patch-o-matic.
  See http://www.netfilter.org for authorship, documentation, and newest versions.
  The other three are described on www.docum.org (I think). They're just one-liners,
  change some defines that are not accessible from kernel configuration.
