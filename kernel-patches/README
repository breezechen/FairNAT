Kernel patches (not made by me) I use together with Fair NAT script.
The script will work without them - but I recommend using them.
Check Fair NAT documentation for details.

If you're using newer 2.4 kernels and the patches do not work anymore,
contact me. Since I'm using 2.4, I may have working ones for them.

If you're using kernel 2.6, I'd happy to hear about wether Fair NAT
works there or not in general. I have no patches for 2.6 at all,
I don't even know if they're still required.

--- List of patches: ---
ttl-2.4.18:     Adds TTL target support. Allows modifying of TTL
                (time to live) value of outgoing packets.
sfq:            Will reduce queue length to 16.
psched:         Will use CPU timing instead of JIFFIES.
                Probably fixes some accuracy issues.
htb:            Disables HTB_HYSTERIES. May result in lower latency,
                but slightly lower rates too.

Note: All patches are optional. The script works without them,
      although you may get an error message here or there.
      I recommend using the patches since I get better performance with them.
      However use them at your own risk only in any case.
