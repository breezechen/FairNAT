connmark-2.4.26

  This is the CONNMARK patch (Author: Henrik Nordstrom <hno@marasystems.com>)
  Get the newest version from patch-o-matic-ng (http://www.netfilter.org)

  Please note that this patch does NOT work together with iptables 1.2.9.
  You need at least iptables 1.2.10 (at the moment, the iptables-cvs Version).

  If you don't want to use iptables-cvs, you can also use an OLD version
  of this patch. However, I have no idea where to find a working one for
  newer 2.4 kernels. Try patch-o-matic (not -ng), maybe you'll get lucky.
